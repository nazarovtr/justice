# Justice Altis Alpha

## Inspiration
The basic idea of guerilla units fighting regular army
and some basic mechanics are inspired by barbolani's Antistasi.
But I intend to make the mission more hardcore.
## Mission background
Year 2040. After 2035 incident Altis has joined CSAT.
The Armed Forces have been equiped by CSAT standards.
Civil rights and corruption situation became even worse.

In 2039 several severe internal CSAT conflicts have been started.
There was a tactical nuke exchange in South-East Asia.
CSAT has withdrawn it's financial support from Altis.
And the international community also has it's attention elsewhere.

Liberal views have started to gain popularity on Altis.
As a reaction to this Altis Prime Minister have consolidated his power.
Internet and mobile connections to the outside world have been severed.
The propoganda machine have been started.
Some of the most notable opposition leaders have disappeared without a trace.

Most of the remaining govenrment resources are beeing spent on the military.
Poverty rises, humanitarian situation deteriorates.

A small opposition group from Agios Konstantinos with some former
AAF military experience decided to start a guerilla movement.
## Why alpha?
Current state in my opinion is a "minimal viable product".
You can play it, you can win and you can loose.
The basic gameplay outline is close enough to what is planned for the final version.

But the testing has been provided only by me and a couple of my friends.
Some very important features like counterattacks are not there.
Some mechanics are implemented on the most basic level.
Mission balance is likely not very good.

When all the intended features are there and the most crude solutions
are fixed I'll move the mission to Beta stage.
